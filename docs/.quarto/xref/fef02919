Tools can be broken up into two main categories: piloting tools, which are used for survey planning and execution, and processing tools which are used in post-mission analyses. The processing tools can further be broken up into flight, acoustic, and cetacean encounter processing tools. The cetacean encounter processing tools can incorporate externally identified cetacean detections (white balloon) or process on-board detections if available.","key":"fig-components","order":{"number":1,"section":[0,1,0,0,0,0,0]}}],"headings":["background","dependencies","matlab-toolboxes","matlab-file-exchange","basemap-rasters","test-dataset","disclaimer"]}
