In the future, we may try modify the mapping tools to work with the freely available `m_map` package to make it more accessible, but are not there yet!\n\n#### MATLAB File Exchange\n\nThis package requires a few resources from MATLAB File Exchange. They come packaged within the `utils/fileExchange` folder.

Detailed basemaps are available from [NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/etopo-global-relief-model).  \n\nThere are tradeoffs in the resolution of basemap raster selected.\n\n- High resolution basemaps are necessary for fine-scale piloting to ensure the glider does not hit the bottom, but they require manual export of a .tiff from NCEI. 15 arc second is the finest resolution option and can be extracted for the specific area of interest using the [ETOPO Grid Extract tool](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/grid-extract/). The smaller the area extracted, the faster it will load and plot. \n- Lower resolution may be sufficient for post-mission plotting. The global 60 arc second tiff is a good mid-resolution option that is easy, although slow, to download, import, and plot. Alternatively, 60 arc second resolution for just a specific area of interest can be extracted with the [ETOPO Grid Extract tool](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/grid-extract/) providing a smaller file size and faster loading/plotting.  \n\n## Disclaimer\n\n<sub>The scientific results and conclusions, as well as any views or opinions expressed herein, are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA or the Department of Commerce.</sub>\n\n<sub>This repository is a scientific product and is not official communication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the United States Department of Commerce.
